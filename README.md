<h1>Dynamic Drop-down Menus</h1>
<p>This small project demonstrates the use of of drop-down menu dependencies based on user selection from another drop-down menu.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<ul>
<li>Create 2 drop-down menus each containing different data</li>
<li>Based on the users selection in the first drop-down menu, the second drop-down menu populates with data releated to the users selection</li>
<li>If the user changes their mind on the first selection, the list in the second drop-down resets before populating with the updated data based on the new selection from the user</li>
</ul>
<p>
For this example, I used a tax filing schedule with only 2 options in the first drop down menu, the first, <strong><i>TSBP - Quarterly</i></strong> and the second being, <strong><i>TSBP - Semi-Monthly</i></strong>. Depending on the users selection in the first drop-down menu, the second will populate with related data. <br>

<p><strong>Note: this solution is based soley in JavaScript and HTML and does not require the use of JQuery or any other libraries/</strong></p>
